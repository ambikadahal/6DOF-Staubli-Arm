This folder contains a mathematica notebook for formulating and solving inverse kinematics of 6-DOF Industrial Grade Robotic
Arm modeled after Staubli Arm. The folder also contains a pdf file which shows both the code and the output of the notebook.
The notebook uses a copyright algorithm for vector notations by "Alan A. Barhorst (Texas Tech University and currently
at UL Lafayette)" and distributed for academic use for students at Texas Tech University. However, the vector notation file 
that contains the copyright algorithm is not provided in this folder.

The pdf file contains detailed code, explaination of methods used to formulate equation of motions, and other informations.

This notebook is not intended for industrial purposes. The sole intention of this notebook is to show how to formulate the
Forward and Inverse Kinematics of a Robotic Arm, and therefore free to lookup and download the .pdf and .nb file. 

Note: The .nb file will throw error because the "vector notation" file is not included.
